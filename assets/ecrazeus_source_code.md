  Since action RPGs tend to be popular, feel free to use the code to help create your own! It's got a rogue-like randomization of pre-exisiting levels past the castle level, dual weapons, weapon switching, jumping and stomping, alongside items, upgradable loot, and more. This game only works with controllers for now, but it's possible to make it playable with Keyboard and Mouse.
