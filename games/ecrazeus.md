  ECRAZEUS is an arcade action diet roguelite game where you play as an angel fighting demons in the afterlife. It features dual-wielding weapons, powerups, and endless levels.

  This was made for the RPG Developer Bakin Halloween Game Jam of 2024. I originally considered expanding on this game for a full game release, but that was abandonned early on after some research and development, as I focused on utilizing RPG Developer Bakin's strengths (turn-based RPGs) rather than keep going against the flow.
