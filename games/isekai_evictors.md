  The year is 203X, and the youth of the United States have been running away into other worlds, or "isekai". Sending people into isekais has become a profitable business, as the demand has skyrocketed following poor living conditions in the real world. You play as Charlie and Ashley, two agents of ISEKAI EVICTORS, a company that rescues people from isekais and teaches them the joys of real life. You'll use magical guns to shoot down the isekai'd youth and bring them back to reality.

  The game was created for the RPG Developer Bakin Summer Game Jam of 2024.
