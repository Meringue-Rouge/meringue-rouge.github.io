  Selling Summer on Christmas Eve is a salesman simulator where you have to make enough money to pay off your summerwear company's debt before Christmas Eve. It's set in a coastal city during a snowy night, and you have to talk to civilians, negotiate prices, and avoid selling low.

  This was created for the RPG Developer Bakin Christmas Jam 2024. It won the Runner-Up prize.
