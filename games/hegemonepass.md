  Hegemone Pass is a Stealth JRPG set in the Greek Underworld, where you play as Persephone, trying to retrieve her throne from Demeter. This is an old demo version of the game.

  This used to be a game in development, with the intention of a full release, but a tumultous development cycle during a very difficult period of my life, alongside a failed Kickstarter, and a creative vision that swayed too severely, led to it's cancellation.

  Although, I'm still impressed that I managed to get an RPG system working in HaxeFlixel, an engine with no Turn-based RPG systems to begin with. All from scratch! And a built-in cutscene editor!
