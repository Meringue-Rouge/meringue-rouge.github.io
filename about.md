Hello! Iâ€™m Meringue Rouge, formerly known as ingenoire (and ingenoireP on X)!

Currently, my focus has returned to game development, after a hiatus in 2020. You can thank PSO2 for that long hiatus.

## What's this site about?
This site acts as a all-in-one repository for all the assets, add-ons, extensions, game releases, and more, regarding the RPG Developer Bakin engine.

## What I Do
- **News**: Keeping you updated with the latest in my world.
- **Assets**: Providing downloadable resources for your projects.
- **Games**: Developing fun, retro-futuristic experiences.

Feel free to explore my work or connect with me on social media!
