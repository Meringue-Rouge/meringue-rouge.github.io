# About Me

Hello! I’m Meringue Rouge, a passionate creator in the digital realm. Born from a love of vibrant aesthetics and innovative ideas, I’ve been crafting content since 2022. My work spans news, assets, and games, all infused with a unique Y2K-inspired flair.

## My Journey
I started with simple designs, experimenting with colors and shapes, and gradually built a portfolio that reflects my evolving style. Today, I’m excited to share my creations with you through this site.

## What I Do
- **News**: Keeping you updated with the latest in my world.
- **Assets**: Providing downloadable resources for your projects.
- **Games**: Developing fun, retro-futuristic experiences.
